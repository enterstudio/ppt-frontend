## PoolParty frontend

I noticed that with the current PoolParty version (the live one, Version 5.4.1, revision 10614) the default (/opt/poolparty/data/frontendRoot/default) directory where the files in this repo sit, doesn't get rebuilt when PPT restarts as before. This means we can simply replace the current default folder.
