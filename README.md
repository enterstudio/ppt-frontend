## PoolParty (PPT) frontend (FE) customisation

This is the customisation for http://joinedupdata.org.

---

I noticed that with the current PoolParty version (the live one, Version 5.4.1, revision 10614) the default (/opt/poolparty/data/frontendRoot/default) directory where the files in this repo sit, doesn't get rebuilt when PPT restarts as before. This means we can simply replace the current default folder.

---

It looks like PPT rebuilds the two folders in `/opt/poolparty/data/frontendRoot/` i.e., `custom` & `default`. Therefore, to make the customisations live, it was necessary to delte the `custom` folder and to replace the `default` folder when PPT is on. We have not tested the behaviour after a restart. There is a possblity that the customisation will again be wiped after a restart. If so, should this be looked into? It's not sustainable for us to redo this every time we reboot the software.

It has been confirmed that the customisation gets wiped after a restart.
